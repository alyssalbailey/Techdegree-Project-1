        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>In college, all student organizations were eligible to have a free website; however, you had to build it yourself. I accepted this challenge and got lost in learning and building a very basic website. It was the most exciting, albeit frustrating time I ever spent in front of a computer screen. </p>
        <p>Fast forward many years, and I get hired at a digital marketing agency. Oh, how much I loved social media! It was my goal to build social libraries and do community management for a variety of our clients.</p>
        <p>The beautiful thing about working in a digital marketing agency is that you’re surrounded by very talented people with very different skill sets. So, it was only a matter of time that I would jump the “social media guru” fantasy and discover something way more awesome: front-end development.</p>
        <p>Eventually, with the help of my colleagues, I built my first responsive table (okay, I only plugged in the data). Then I began uploading all the website copy into the CMS via HTML. Now, I’m enrolled in a Techdegree and I’m very excited about what coding adventures are ahead. </p>
